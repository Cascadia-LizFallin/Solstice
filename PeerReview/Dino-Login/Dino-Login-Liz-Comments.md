SHA: 48ef8f2d3b395c2a63ef4dcc4e53be13ceeda189

## Files
- Login.aspx.cs

#Comments
- Need more comments.
- Whitespace is good as long as it separates logical blocks (e.g. an if-then when there's more than just one line). Two lines of whitespace need to be changed to one.
- Add a header to the partial class Login
- Use comments to explain the encryption and the SQL statements
